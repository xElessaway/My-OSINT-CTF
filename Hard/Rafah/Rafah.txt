Hey there, buddy. I've got a critical mission for you. There's a Russian cybercriminal we need to track down. He's running a Telegram channel where he sells personal data and access to hacked devices, plus heâ€™s extorting victims for cash. The good news? There's a decryption script floating around the internet. Can you track down the MD5 of that script and find out when the Telegram channel was created? Good luck!
